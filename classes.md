# Classes and ids

Classes are filters that can be applied to an arbitrary section of a document They look like this:

```
.green-text {
	color: green;
}
```

and are used in HTML like this:

```
<div class="green-text">
	<p>Some green text</p>
</div>
```

Ids are like classes, but can only be used once in a document. They look like this in the CSS:


```
#green-text {
	color: green;
}
```

And in the HTML:

```
<div id="green-text">
	<p>Some green text</p>
</div>
```
