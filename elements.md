# Tags and Elements

Tags and elements are the structuring components of a page. 

Elements identify the different parts of a page, such as paragraphs, headings, titles, body text, images and more. Elements are demarcated by tags which enclose the content of an element.

Tags demarcate elements in one of two ways. As with the paragraph element below, an element can have an opening and a closing tag, with the content in between. 

	<p>This is a paragraph</p>

Elements can have other elements inside them, and generally, it is these elements that require a closing tag for clarity.

	<p>When I came home from school, I saw he had <strong>stolen</strong> my chocolate pudding.</p>

Other elements have self-closing tags or void tags, as with the image element below. These elements don't require a separate closing tag because you wouldn't add additional elements within the image element.
