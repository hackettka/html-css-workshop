# Tags and Elements

An element in HTML looks like this:

	<p>This is a paragraph</p>
	
The element includes the opening `<p>` tag, the closing `<p>` tags, and the content in between. Elements can have other elements inside them, like this:

	<p>When I came home from school, I saw he had <strong>stolen</strong> my chocolate pudding.</p>
