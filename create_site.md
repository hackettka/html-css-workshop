ACTIVITY:

Now, using the tags we've reviewed, and two additional ones, see below, create a site for a course you teach. 

You site should include:
    <ul>
        <li> A head and a body </li>
        <li> A title for the page </li>
        <li> One heading </li>
        <li> One paragraph </li>
        <li> One image </li>
        <li> One list to serve as a menu </li>
        <li> One break, which add space between different elements</li>

For the last two items, use the following tags:

```
<ul> 
    <li> item 1 </li>
    <li> item 2 </li>
    <li> item 3 </li>
<ul> 
```

```
<br/> 
```

Ready, set, go!
