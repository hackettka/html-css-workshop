<body>

<center><h1>This text is centered</h1></center>



<p>Note that whitespace has no effect in HTML. You can put your entire document on one line, though this is not recommended.</p>



<p>You can use tags to <em>provide emphasis</em>. You may also still see the old <i>italic</i> and <b>bold</b> tags still in use. You've probably also noticed that you're allow to nest tags inside one another.</p>

<p align="right">This p tag has an "attribute" that makes it align to the right of the screen. Attributes are a useful way to change the behavior of a tag.</p>
