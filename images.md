# Images

Images are created with the `<img>` tag. THe `src` attribute tells the browser where the image is located.

	<img src="scream.jpeg">
	
Which produces this, assuming that `scream.jpg` is in the same folder:

<img src="scream.jpeg">

The image tag has no closing tag. Tags with no closing tag, like `<!DOCTYPE>` and `<img>`, are called void tags.
