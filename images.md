# Images

Images are another important component of websites. 

Images are created with the `<img>` tag. Similar to the `href`, the `src` attribute offers secondary information to the browser, telling it where the image is located. The `src` attribute stands for source. 

The following sequence is telling your browser to pull in an image located in the same folder as the doc: 

	<img src="scream.jpeg">
	
ACTIVITY:
Download and save an image from the web, or move an image from your computer into the same folder as your 'index.html' file. 

Using the code above as a reference, add that image into your `index.html` file, re-save the file, and re-open or refresh the page in your browser. 

Challenge: Looking at the code in your `index.html` file, what type of tag is the `<img>` tag? 

Hint: Compare this tag with your `<p>` tag.
