# Basic Template for HTML

HTML documents start with a DOCTYPE declaration that states what version of HTML is being used. HTML documents also have a head section and a body section. This is the basic template for an empty HTML document:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
</head>

<body>
</body>

</html>
```
